## About

<p>**$NASA**

Launched in June 6th 2021, NASA or Not Another Shit Altcoin is a token built and deployed on the Binance Smart Chain network. NASA utilizes the raw power of memes to facilitate its goal of becoming the dependable memecoin of the future. 

All transactions are taxed at 10%, 5% of which is added to the liquidity pool and 5% is distributed out to each at every holder thus making NASA an attractive investment option. In addition to this, 5% of the initial supply was burnt making the token more scarce as time goes by..</p>

## FAQ

<p>

**What is the contract ID?**
0x70cf8d40a3d0f7bc88077ba7d103050d0001a653

**How do $NASA's tokenomics work?**

5% of all transactions are automatically transferred into our liquidity pool. The main benefit of this is that it continually raises the price floor which in turn contributes to price stability. In addition to this, 5% of all transactions are reflected back to each and every holder regardless of how many tokens that individual has which directly incentivises long term investing.


**Is Liquidity Locked?**

One requirement of listing on DxSale is that the token in question must specify a period of time in which the token will be locked for. Our token has liquidity lock set to max. This ensures that the tokens within the LP will never be accessed for as long as you are alive, preventing any attempt at a rug pull.


**What does it mean to have ownership renounced and LP burned?**

Controlling shares of the token have been burned meaning that no one can retrieve the initial liquidity provided to PancakeSwap to enable trading, as well as no one can make any alterations to the smart contract. That makes $NASA unruggable as there is no ability to access the mint function to change the supply or alter the current tokenomics.


**What is the token distribution?**

5% developer wallet, 5% burnt, 90% holders.


**What are NASA’s use cases ?**

1) **NASA Auditing Service** - The goal of the NASA Auditing Service is to expose scam projects, improve safety to investors and instil confidence in BSC projects. We have experienced auditors who will complete a Smart Contract Security Audit on other BSC projects with delivery in PDF format that includes errors/bugs we find and recommendations for improvement. The BIG win for NASA investors is that our profits from the NASA Seal of Approval will be invested back into NASA so holders are rewarded for loyalty and watch their investment continue to grow. We are excited to share that our first Smart Contract Security Audit is almost complete.

2)**NASA Rug Pull Relief Fund** - There is nothing worse than getting excited about a project or new token launch only to have your hard-earned investment pulled unexpectedly by bad actors and left with nothing. At NASA, a portion of reflections from our marketing wallet will be used to give back to active NASA investors who have been rug pulled on other investments via an application process.
